This is the data Analysis Project for the SEAP-SEES Project. This project analyzes drinking water and river water from across the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal for evidence of typhoidal Salmonellas. 

#####  Project Overview --------------------------------------------- ################

<<<<<<< HEAD
Background: Enteric Fever is endemic throughout much of South Asia and is thought to be spread through contaminated food and water. To better understand the transmission pathways of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A in Nepal, we conducted environmental surveillance of both drinking water and surface water in the greater Kathmandu Valley. 

Methodology: We collected 1L drinking water samples between February and October 2019 from a representative sample of households in Kathmandu and peri-urban and rural communities of neighboring Kavrepalanchok district, both areas with high typhoid incidence. Between November 2019 and July 2021, we collected 50 mL monthly river water samples at 19 surveillance sites from five rivers in and around the Kathmandu valley. On each sampling trip team members also collected structured observations of water usage practices and sewage drainage into the rivers. In each sampling visit, a negative control sample of sterile water was carried to the field and processed in the same manner as the river water samples. Samples were processed using differential centrifugation and incubated in Selenite F for 16 hours. DNA extraction was performed prior to incubation and after 16 hours of incubation. Real-time PCR was performed and a decrease in Ct values of >3 between the two time points was interpreted as evidence of bacterial replication. 

Results: None of the (0/400) drinking water samples tested positive for S. Typhi and 2/400 tested positive for S. Paratyphi. 43% (146/342) percent of river water samples tested positive for S. Typhi and 35% (101/285) of samples tested positive for S. Paratyphi A at the sixteen-hour extraction point.  39% (135/342) of river water samples showed signs of S. Typhi bacterial replication and 33% (95/285) of samples indicated S. Paratyphi replication. Samples from locations with low population density upstream of Kathmandu rarely were contaminated with S. Typhi (9.7%, 7/72), locations within the city center were often contaminated (64% (58/90) of the time), and locations 10km downstream of Kathmandu were contaminated 61% (11/18) of the time. During the monsoon season (June through August), the number of typhoid cases peak in the city; however, fecal coliform counts and the percentage of samples positive for typhoidal Salmonella were lowest, possibly due to bacterial dilution in the river water, as flow rates and turbidity were greatest. We observed use of contaminated river water sites for bathing, washing clothes, washing vegetables for sale in markets and irrigating agricultural fields. 

Conclusions: We found household water contamination with typhoidal Salmonella to be rare in Kathmandu and Kavrepalanchok. However, river water in Kathmandu and up to 10 km downstream were highly contaminated with Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A. The use of this water for irrigation and washing vegetables may constitute a transmission pathway for typhoidal Salmonella in these high burden communities.
